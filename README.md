# JavaScript Fundamentals Code Quiz

[Link to live deploy](https://ltrokey.github.io/javascript_code_quiz/)

## Description

As a software developer, I embarked on a creative journey to design an engaging JavaScript quiz using the trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My primary motivation was twofold: to craft a visually vibrant quiz that would entertain users and, more importantly, to facilitate the learning of fundamental JavaScript concepts. Throughout this project, I encountered a few hurdles, notably grappling with web-based local storage to store user progress and struggling with the precise timing of content display. These challenges tested my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web development intricacies. However, the most profound lesson I gathered from this endeavor was the boundless versatility of JavaScript, which left me in awe of its infinite possibilities for creating interactive and educational experiences.
